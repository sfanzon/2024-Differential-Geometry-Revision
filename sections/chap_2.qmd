# Topology



::: Definition
### Topological space   {#definition-topology}

Let $X$ be a set and $\TT$ a collection of subsets of $X$. We say that $\TT$ is a **topology** on $X$ if the following 3 properties hold:

- (A1) The sets $\emptyset, X$ belong to $\TT$,

- (A2) If $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ is an arbitrary family of elements of $\TT$, then
$$
\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i  \in \TT \,.
$$

- (A3) If $A,B \in \TT$ then $A \cap B \in \TT$.

Further, we say:

- The pair $(X,\TT)$ is a **topological space**.
- The elements of $X$ are called **points**.
- The sets in the topology $\TT$ are called **open sets**.
:::





::: Definition
### Trivial topology

Let $X$ be a set. The **trivial topology** on $X$ is the collection of sets
$$
\TTt := \{  \emptyset , X \} \,.
$$


:::



::: Definition
### Discrete topology

Let $X$ be a set. The **discrete topology** on $X$ is the collection of all subsets of $X$
$$
\TTd := \{ A \divider A \subseteq X \} \,.
$$


:::




::: Definition
### Open set of $\R^n$

Let $A \subseteq \R^n$. We say that the set $A$ is **open** if it holds:
$$
\forall \, \xx \in A \,, \,\, \exists \, r > 0 \st B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \,,
$${#eq-open-set-Rn}
where $B_r(\xx)$ is the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $\xx$
$$
B_r(\xx) := \{ \yy \in \R^n \divider \norm{ \yy - \xx } < r  \} \,, 
$$
and the **Euclidean norm** of $\xx \in \R^n$ is defined by 
$$
\| \xx \| := \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^2 } \,.
$$

:::



::: Definition
### Euclidean topology of $\R^n$  {#definition-euclidean-topology}

The **Euclidean topology** on $\R^n$ is the collection of sets
$$
\TTe := \{ A \divider A \subseteq \R^n \,, \,\, A \, \mbox{ is open}  \} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof
### $\TTe$ is a topology on $\R^n$

To prove $\TTe$ is a topology on $\R^n$, we need to check the axioms:

- (A1) We have $\emptyset , \R^n \in \TTe$: Indeed $\emptyset$ is open because there is no point $\xx$ for which (@eq-open-set-Rn) needs to be checked. Moreover, $\R^n$ is open because (@eq-open-set-Rn) holds with any radius $r>0$. 

- (A2) Let $A_i \in \TTe$ for all $i \in I$. Define the union
  $A =\bigcup_i A_i$. We need to check that $A$ is open. Let $\xx \in A$. By definition of union, there exists an index $i_0 \in I$ such that
  $\xx \in A_{i_0}$. Since $A_{i_0}$ is open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exists $r>0$ such that 
  $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A_{i_0}$. As $A_{i_0} \subseteq A$, we conclude that $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A$, so that $A \in \TTe$.

 - (A3) Let $A, B \in \TTe$. 
  We need to check that $A \cap B$ is open. Let $\xx \in A \cap B$. Therefore $\xx \in A$ and $\xx \in B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are open, by (@eq-open-set-Rn) there exist $r_1,r_2>0$ such that 
  $B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A$ and $B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B$. Set $r := \min\{ r_1,r_2\}$. Then 
  $$
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_1}(\xx) \subseteq A  \,, \quad 
  B_r(\xx) \subseteq B_{r_2}(\xx) \subseteq B  \,, 
  $$
  Hence $B_r(\xx) \subseteq A \cap B$, showing that $A \cap B  \in \TTe$.

This proves that $\TTe$ is a topology on $\R^n$.

:::





::: Proposition   
### $B_r(\xx)$ is an open set of $\TTe$ {#proposition-balls-open}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with the Euclidean topology $\TTe$. Let $r>0$ and $\xx \in \R^n$. Then $B_r(\xx) \in \TTe$.

:::




::: Definition 
### Closed set

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. A set $C \subseteq X$ is **closed**
if 
$$
C^c   \in \TT \,, 
$$
where $C^c:= X \smallsetminus C$ is the complement of $C$ in $X$.
:::



::: Definition
### Comparing topologies

Let $X$ be a set and let $\TT_1$, $\TT_2$ be topologies on $X$. 

1. $\TT_1$ is **finer** than $\TT_2$ if $\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1$. 


2. $\TT_1$ is **strictly finer** than $\TT_2$ if $\TT_2 \subsetneq \TT_1$.

3. $\TT_1$ and $\TT_2$ are the **same** topology if $\TT_1 = \TT_2$.
:::





::: Example
### Comparing $\TTt$ and $\TTd$

Let $X$ be a set. Then $\TT_{\textrm{trivial}} \subseteq \TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$.

:::



::: Example
### Cofinite topology on $\R$

**Question.** The **cofinite topology** on $\R$ is the collection of sets
$$
\TTcof := \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \}\,. 
$$

1. Prove that $(\R,\TTcof)$ is a topological space.
2. Prove that $\TTcof \subseteq \TTe$.
3. Prove that $\TTcof \neq \TTe$.


**Solution. Part 1.** Show that the topology properties are satisfied:

(A1) We have $\emptyset \in \TTcof$, since $\emptyset^c = \R$. We have $\R \in \TTcof$ because ${\R}^c = \emptyset$ is finite.

(A2) Let $U_i \in \TTcof$ for all $i \in I$, and define
$U := \bigcup_{i \in I} \,  U_i$. 
By the De Morgan's laws we have
$$
U^c = \left( \cup_{i \in I} \,  U_i    \right)^c = \cap_{i \in I} \, U_i^c \,.
$$
We have two cases:

1. There exists $i_0 \in I$ such that $U_{i_0}^c$ is finite. Then 
$$
U^c = \cap_{i \in I} U_i^c \subset U_{i_0}^c \,,
$$
and therefore $U^c$ is finite, showing that $U \in \TTcof$.

2. None of the sets $U_i^c$ is finite. Therefore $U_i^c = \R$ for all $i \in I$, from which we deduce 
$$
U^c = \cap_{i \in I} U_i^c = \R \quad \implies \quad U \in \TTcof\,.
$$
   
In both cases, we have $U \in \TTcof$, so that (A2) holds.
		
(A3) Let $U,V \in \TTcof$. Set $A=U \cap V$. Then
$$
A^c = U^c \cup V^c \,.
$$
We have $2$ possibilities:

1. $U^c, V^c$ finite: Then $A^c$ is finite, and $A \in \TTcof$.

2. $U^c = \R$ or $V^c = \R$: Then $A^c = \R$, and $A \in \TTcof$.  
    
In all cases, we have shown that $A \in \TTcof$, so that (A3) holds.


**Part 2.** Let $U \in \TTcof$. We have two cases:

- $U^c$ is finite. Then $U^c = \{x_1, \ldots,x_n\}$ for some points $x_i \in \R$. Up to relabeling the points, we can assume that $x_i < x_j$ when $i < j$. Therefore,
$$
U =  \{x_1, \ldots,x_n\}^c = \bigcup_{i=0}^{n} (x_i,x_{i+1}) \,, \quad x_0 := -\infty,\quad x_{n+1} := \infty \,.
$$
The sets $(x_i,x_{i+1})$ are open in $\TTe$, and therefore $U \in \TTe$.

- $U^c = \R$. Then $U = \emptyset$, which belongs to $\TTe$ by (A1).

In both cases, $U \in \TTe$. Therefore $\TTcof \subseteq \TTe$.

**Part 3.** consider the interval $U=(0,1)$. Then $U \in \TTe$. However $U^c$ is neither $\R$, nor finite. Thus $U \notin \TTcof$.

## Sequences

::: Definition
### Convergent sequence

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. Consider a sequence $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ and a point
$x \in X$. We say that $x_n$ converges to $x_0$ in the topology $\TT$, if the following property holds:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \forall \, U \in \TT  \st x_0 \in U\,, \,\, \exists \, N = N(U) \in \N \st  \\
& x_n \in U \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-convergence}

The convergence of $x_n$ to $x_0$ is denoted by $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Proposition
### Convergent sequences in $\TTt$ {#proposition-convergence-trivial}


Let $X$ be equipped with $\TTt$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$, $x_0 \in X$. Then $x_n \to x_0$.


:::



::: Proof

To show that $x_n \to x_0$ we need to check that (@eq-convergence) holds. Let 
$U \in \TTt$ with $x_0 \in U$. We have two cases:

- $U = \emptyset$: There is nothing to prove, since $x_0$ cannot be in $U$. 

- $U = X$: Take $N=1$. Since $U = X$, we have $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq 1$.  

Thus (@eq-convergence) holds for all the sets $U \in \TTt$, showing that $x_n \to x_0$.

:::



::: Warning

Proposition \ref{proposition-convergence-trivial} shows the topological limit may **not be unique**!

:::



::: Proposition
### Convergent sequences in $\TTd$

Let $X$ be equipped with $\TTd$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$, $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:


1. $x_n \to x_0$ in the topology $\TTd$.
2. $\{x_n\}$ is eventually constant: $\exists \, N \in \N \, \st \, x_n = x_0 , \, \forall \, n \geq N$

:::



::: Proof

*Part 1.* Assume that $x_n \to x_0$. Let $U = \{x_0\}$.
Then $U \in \TTd$. Since $x_n \to x_0$, by (@eq-convergence) there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
x_n \in U  \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
As $U = \{x_0\}$, we infer $x_n = x_0$ for all $n \geq N$. Hence $x_n$ is eventually constant. 


*Part 2.* Assume that $x_n$ is eventually equal to $x_0$, that is, there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n = x_0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-convergence-discrete}
Let $U \in \TT$ be an open set such that $x_0 \in U$. By (@eq-convergence-discrete) we have
that 
$$
x_n \in U \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Since $U$ was arbitrary, we conclude that $x_n \to x_0$.
:::



::: Definition
### Classical convergence in $\R^n$

Let $\{\xx_n\} \subseteq \R^n$ and $\xx_0 \in \R^n$. We say that $\xx_n$ converges $\xx_0$ in the 
classical sense if $\norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} \to 0$, that is,
$$
\forall \, \e>0 , \, \exists \, N \in \N , \, \st \norm{\xx_n - \xx_0} < \e  \,, \, \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$

:::



::: Proposition
### Convergent sequences in $\TTe$  {#proposition-convergence-Rn}

Let $\R^n$ be equipped with $\TTe$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq \R^n$, $x_0 \in \R^n$. They are equivalent:


1. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the topology $\TTe$.
2. $\xx_n \to \xx_0$ in the classical sense.

## Metric spaces


::: Definition 
### Distance and Metric space

Let $X$ be a set. A **distance** on $X$ is a function 
$d \colon X \times X \to \R$ such that, for all $x,y,z \in X$ they hold:

- (M1) Positivity: $d(x,y) \geq 0$ and $d(x,y) = 0 \, \iff \, x=y$

- (M2) Symmetry: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$

- (M3) Triangle Inequality: $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

The pair $(X,d)$ is called a **metric space**.

:::




::: Definition
### Euclidean distance on $\R^n$

The **Euclidean distance** over $\R^n$ is defined by
$$
d(\xx,\yy) := \norm{ \xx - \yy } = \left(  \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^2   \right)^{1/2}  \,, \quad \forall \xx,\yy \in \R^n \,.
$$
:::


::: Proposition

Let $d$ be the Euclidean distance on $\R^n$. Then $(\R^n,d)$ is a metric space.

:::



::: Definition
### Topology induced by the metric  {#definition-metric-topology}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. The set $A \subseteq X$ is **open** if it holds
$$
\forall \, x \in U \,, \, \exists \, r \in \R, \, r > 0 \, \st \, B_r(x) \subseteq U \,,
$$
where $B_r(x)$ is the ball centered at $x$ of radius $r$, defined by 
$$
B_r(x) = \{ y \in X  \, \colon \,  d(x,y)<r  \} \,.
$$
The topology **induced by the metric** $d$ is the
collection of sets
$$
\TT_d = \{ U\, \colon \, U \subseteq X, \, U \text{ open}   \}\,.
$$

:::




::: Remark
### Topology induced by Euclidean distance

Consider the metric space $(\R^n,d)$ with $d$ the Euclidean distance. Then 
$$
\TT_d = \TTe \,,
$$
where $\TTe$ is the Euclidean topology on $\R^n$. 


:::




::: Example
### Discrete distance

**Question.** Let $X$ be a set. The **discrete distance** is the function $d \colon X \times X \to \R$ defined by
$$
d(x,y) := 
\begin{cases}
	0 & \mbox{ if } \, x = y \\
	1 & \mbox{ if } \, x \neq y 
\end{cases}
$$

1. Prove that $(X,d)$ is a metric space.
2. Prove that $\TT_d = \TT_{\textrm{discrete}}$.


**Solution.** See Question 3 in Homework 3.
:::




::: Proposition
### Convergence in metric space

Suppose $(X,d)$ is a metric space and $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Let $\{x_n\} \subseteq X$ and $x_0 \in X$. They are equivalent:

1. $x_n \to x_0$ with respect to the topology $\TT_d$.
2. $d(x_n,x_0) \to 0$ in $\R$.
3. For all $\e>0$ there exists $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
x_n \in B_r(x_0) \, , \,\, \forall \, n \geq \N \,.

## Hausdorff spaces




::: Definition
### Hausdorff space

We say that a topological space $(X,\TT)$ is **Hausdorff** if for every $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$, there exist $U,V \in \TT$ such that
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$

:::




::: {.Proposition  #proposition-hausdorff-1}

Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$. Then $(X, \TT_d)$ is a Hausdorff space.

:::


::: Proof

Let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Define
$$
U := B_{\e}(x)\,, \quad 
V := B_{\e}(y) \,, \quad \e := \frac12 \, d(x,y) \,.
$$
By Proposition \ref{proposition-metric-ball}, we know that $U, V \in \TT_d$. Moreover $x \in U$, $y \in V$. We are left to show that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.
Suppose by contradiction that $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$ and let $z \in U \cap V$. Therefore 
$$
d(x,z) < \e \,,  \quad d(y,z) < \e \,.
$$
By triangle inequality we have
$$
d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) +  d(y,z) < \e + \e = d(x,y) \,,
$$
where in the last inequality we used the definition of $\e$. This is 
a contradiction. Therefore $U \cap V = \emptyset$ and $(X,\TT_d)$ is Hausdorff.


:::


::: Definition
### Metrizable space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that the topology $\TT$ is **metrizable** if there
exists a metric $d$ on $X$ such that
$$
\TT = \TT_d \,,
$$
with $\TT_d$ the topology induced by $d$.

:::


::: {.Corollary #corollary-hausdorff}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a metrizable space. Then $X$ is Hausforff.

:::





::: Example
### $(X,\TTt)$ is not Hausdorff

**Question.** Let $X$ be equipped with the trivial topology $\TTt$. Then $X$ is not Hausdorff.

**Solution.** Assume by contradiction $(X,\TTt)$ is Hausdorff and let $x,y \in X$ with $x \neq y$. Then, there exist $U,V \in \TTt$ such that 
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
In particular $U \neq \emptyset$ and $V \neq \emptyset$. Since $\TT = \{  \emptyset, X \}$, we conclude that
$$
U = V = X  \quad \implies \quad U \cap V  = X \neq \emptyset \,.
$$
This is a contradiction, and thus $(X,\TTt)$ is not Hausdorff.


:::




::: Example
### $(\R,\TTcof)$ is not Hausdorff

**Question.** Consider the cofinite topology on $\R$
$$
\TTcof = \{ U \subseteq \R \divider U^c \, \mbox{ is finite, }  \mbox{or } U^c = \R \} \,. 
$$
Prove that $(\R,\TTcof)$ is not Hausdorff. 

**Solution.** Assume by contradiction $(\R,\TTcof)$ is Hausdorff and let $x, y \in \R$ with $x \neq y$. Then, there exist $U,V \in \TTcof$ such that 
$$
x \in U \,, \quad y \in V \,, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset \,.
$$
Taking the complement of $U \cap V = \emptyset$, we infer
$$
\R = (U \cap V)^c = U^c \cup V^c \,.
$${#eq-Q31}
There are two possibilities:
	
1. $U^c$ and $V^c$ are finite. Then $U^c \cup V^c$ is finite, so that (@eq-Q31) is a contradiction.

2. Either $U^c = \R$ or $U^c = \R$. If $U^c = \R$, then $U = \emptyset$. This is a contradiction, since $x \in U$. If $V^c = \R$, then $V = \emptyset$. This is a contradiction, since $y \in V$. 

Hence $(\R,\TTcof)$ is not Hausdorff.

::: Example
## Lower-limit topology on $\R$ is not Hausdorff

**Question.** The **lower-limit topology** on $\R$ is the collection of sets
$$
\TTll =\{\emptyset, \R\} \cup \{ (a,+\infty) \, \colon \, a \in \R \} \,.
$$

1. Prove that $(\R,\TTll)$ is a topological space.
2. Prove that $(\R,\TTll)$ is not Hausdorff.

**Solution. Part 1.** We show that $(\R, \TTll)$ is a topological space by verifying the axioms:

(A1) By definition $\emptyset, \R \in \TTll$.

(A2) Let $A_i \in \TTll$ for all $i \in I$. We have 2 cases:

- If $A_i = \emptyset$ for all $i$, then $\cup_i A_i = \emptyset \in \TTll$. 

- At least one of the sets $A_i$ is non-empty. As empty-sets do not contribute to the union, we can discard them. Therefore, $A_i = (-\infty, a_i)$ with $a_i \in \R \cup \{\infty\}$. Define:
$$
a := \sup_{i \in I} a_i, \quad A := (-\infty, a).
$$
Then $A \in \mathcal{T}$ and:
$$
A = \cup_{i \in I} A_i.
$$
To prove this, let $x \in A$. Then $x < a$, so there exists $i_0 \in I$ such that $x < a_{i_0}$. Thus, $x \in A_{i_0}$, showing $A \subseteq \cup_{i \in I} A_i$. Conversely, if $x \in \cup_{i \in I} A_i$, then $x \in A_{i_0}$ for some $i_0 \in I$, implying $x < a_{i_0} \leq a$. Thus, $x \in A$, proving $\cup_{i \in I} A_i \subseteq A$.

(A3) Let $A, B \in \TTll$. We have 3 cases:

- $A = \emptyset$ or $B = \emptyset$. Then $A \cap B = \emptyset \in \TTll$.

- $A \neq \emptyset$ and $B \neq \emptyset$. Therefore, $A = (-\infty, a)$ and $B = (-\infty, b)$ with $a, b \in \R \cup \{\infty\}$. Define
$$
U := A \cap B, \quad z := \min\{a, b\}.
$$
Then $U = (-\infty, z) \in \TTll$.

Thus, $(\R, \TTll)$ is a topological space.

**Part 2.** To show $(\R, \TTll)$ is not Hausdorff, assume otherwise. Let $x, y \in \R$ with $x \neq y$. Then there exist $U, V \in \TTll$ such that:
$$
x \in U, \quad y \in V, \quad U \cap V = \emptyset.
$$
As $U,V$ are non-empty, by definition of $\TTll$, there exist $a, b \in \R \cup \{\infty\}$ such that $U = (-\infty, a)$ and $V = (-\infty, b)$. Define:
$$
z := \min\{a, b\}, \quad Z := U \cap V = (-\infty, z).
$$
Hence $Z \neq \emptyset$, contradicting $U \cap V = \emptyset$. Thus, $(\R, \TTll)$ is not Hausdorff.

1. ${\id}_{X}$ is continuous from $(X,\TT_1)$ to $(X,\TT_2)$.
2. $\TT_1$ is finer than $\TT_2$, that is, $\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1$.

**Solution.** ${\id}_{X}$ is continuous if and only if
$$
{\id}_{X}^{-1} (V) \in \TT_1  \,, \quad \forall \, V \in \TT_2 \,.
$$
But ${\id}_{X}^{-1} (V) = V$, so that the above reads

which is equivalent to $\TT_2 \subseteq \TT_1$.

$f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(\emptyset) = \emptyset \in \TT_X$.

- $V=Y$: Then $f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}(Y) = X \in \TT_X$.

Therefore $f$ is continuous.

::: Example

**Question.** Let $(X,\TT_X)$ and $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Suppose that 
$\TT_Y$ is the discrete topology, that is,
$$
\TT_Y = \{ V \st V \subseteq Y \} \,.
$$
Let $f \colon X \to Y$. Prove that they are equivalent:

1. $f$ is continuous from $X$ to $Y$.
2. $f^{-1}(\{y\}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$.  


**Solution.** Suppose that $f$ is continuous. Then
$$
f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X \,, \quad \forall \,\, V \in \TT_Y \,.
$$
As $V=\{y\} \in \TT_Y$, we conclude that $f^{-1}(\{y\}) \in \TT_X$.

Conversely, assume that $f^{-1}(\{y\}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$.  Let $V \in \TT_Y$. Trivially, we have $V = \cup_{y \in V} \, \{ y \}$.
Therefore 
$$
f^{-1}(V) = f^{-1}\left( \bigcup_{y \in V}\, \{ y \} \right) = \bigcup_{y \in V} \, f^{-1}( \{y \} ) \,.
$$
As $f^{-1}( \{y \}) \in \TT_X$ for all $y \in Y$, by property (A2) we conclude that $f^{-1}(V) \in \TT_X$. Therefore $f$ is continuous.

## Subspace topology


::: Definition
### Subspace topology   {#definition-subspace-topology}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $Y \subseteq X$ a subset. Define the family of sets
\begin{align*}
\SSS & := \{ A \subseteq Y \divider \exists \,\, U \in \TT \st A = U \cap Y   \} \\
     & = \{ U \cap Y , \,\, U \in \TT  \} \,.
\end{align*}
The family $\SSS$ is the **subspace topology** on $Y$ induced by the inclusion $Y \subseteq X$.

:::



::: Proposition

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space and $Y \in \TT$. Let  
$A \subseteq Y$. Then
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \iff \quad A \in \TT \,.
$$

:::



::: Warning

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space, $A \subseteq Y \subseteq X$. In general we could have
$$
A \in \SSS \quad \mbox{and} \quad A \notin \TT \,.
$$

**Example.** Let $X=\R$ with $\TTe$. Consider the subset $Y = [0,2)$, and equip $Y$ with the subspace topology $\SSS$. Let $A = [0,1)$. Then $A \notin \TTe$ but $A \in \SSS$, since 
$$
A =  (-1,1)  \cap Y \,, \qquad (-1,1) \in \TTe \,.
$$


:::




::: Example

**Question.** Let $X=\R$ be equipped with $\TTe$. Let 
$\SSS$ be the subspace topology on $\Z$. Prove that
$$
\SSS = \TTd \,.
$$


**Solution.** To prove that $\SSS = \TTd$, we need to show that all the subsets of $\Z$ are open in $\SSS$.

1. Let $z \in \Z$ be arbitrary. Notice that 
$$
\{z\} = \left(  z-1 , z + 1   \right)   \cap \Z \,
$$
and $(z - 1, z + 1) \in \TTe$. Thus $\{z\} \in \SSS$. 

2. Let now $A \subseteq \Z$ be an arbitrary subset. Trivially,
$$
A = \cup_{z \in A} \, \{ z \} \,.
$$
As $\{z\} \in \SSS$, we infer that $A \in \SSS$ by (A2).

## Connectedness

::: Definition
### Connected space

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that:

1. $X$ is **connected** if the only subsets of $X$ which are both open and closed are $\emptyset$ and $X$. 
2. $X$ is **disconnected** if it is not connected.

::: Definition
### Proper subset

Let $X$ be a set. A subset $A \subseteq X$ is **proper** if 
$A \neq \emptyset$ and $A \neq X$.

:::


::: Proposition
### Equivalent definition for connectedness {#proposition-connected-equivalent}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. They are equivalent:

1. $X$ is disconnected.
2. $X$ is the disjoint union of two proper open subsets.
3. $X$ is the disjoint union of two proper closed subsets. 

:::



::: Example

**Question.** Consider the set $X = \{0,1\}$ with the subspace topology induced by the inclusion $X \subseteq \R$, where $\R$ is equipped with the
Euclidean topology $\TTe$. Prove that $X$ is disconnected.

**Solution.** Note that 
$$
X = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ 1 \} \,, \quad \{ 0 \} \cap \{ 1 \} = \emptyset \,.
$$
The set $\{ 0 \}$ is open for the subspace topology, since
$$
\{ 0 \} = X \cap (-1,1) \,, \quad 
(-1,1) \in \TTe \,.
$$
Similarly, also $\{ 1 \}$ is open for the subspace topology, since
$$
\{ 1 \} = X \cap (0,2) \,, \quad 
(0,2) \in \TTe \,.
$$
Since $\{ 0 \}$ and $\{ 1 \}$ are proper subsets of $X$, 
we conclude that $X$ is disconnected.

:::


::: {.Example  #example-R-minus-p}

**Question.** Let $\R$ be equipped with $\TTe$, and let $p \in \R$. Prove that the set $X = \R \smallsetminus \{p\}$ is disconnected. 

**Solution.** Define the sets 
$$ 
A = (-\infty,p) \,, \quad B = (p , \infty) \,.
$$
$A$ and $B$ are proper subsets of $X$. Moreover 
$$
X = A \cup B \,,  \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Finally, $A,B$ are open for the subspace topology on $X$, since
they are open in $(\R,\TTe)$. Therefore $X$ is disconnected.

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be topological spaces. Suppose that
$f \colon X \to Y$ is continuous and let $f(X) \subseteq Y$ be 
equipped with the subspace topology. If $X$ is connected, then $f(X)$ is connected.

::: Theorem  
### Connectedness is topological invariant {#theorem-invariant-connected}

Let $(X,\TT_X)$, $(Y,\TT_Y)$ be homeomorhic topological spaces. 
Then
$$
X \, \mbox{ is connected } \,\, \iff \,\,
Y \, \mbox{ is connected } 
$$

:::


::: Example

**Question.** Define the one dimensional unit circle
$$
\sphere^1 := \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, \colon \, x^2 + y^2 = 1 \} \,.
$$
Prove that $\sphere^1$ and $[0,1]$ are not homeomorphic. 


**Solution.** Suppose by contradiction that there exists a homeomorphism
$$
f  \colon [0,1] \to \mathbb{S}^1 \,.
$$
The restriction of $f$ to $[0,1] \smallsetminus \{\frac12\}$ defines a homeomorphism 
$$
g \ \colon \left( [0,1] \smallsetminus \left\{\frac12\right\} \right) \to \left( \sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\} \right) \,, \quad \mathbf{p} := f\left(\frac12 \right) \,.
$$
The set $[0,1] \smallsetminus \left\{ \frac12 \right\}$ is disconnected, 
since 
$$
[0,1] \smallsetminus \{1/2\} = [0,1/2) \, \cup \, (1/2,1] 
$$
with $[0,1/2)$ and $(1/2,1]$ open for the subset topology, non-empty and disjoint. Therefore, using that $g$ is a homeomorphism, we conclude that also $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is disconnected. Let $\theta_0 \in [0,2\pi)$ be the unique angle such that 
$$
\mathbf{p} = (\cos (\theta_0),\sin(\theta_0)) \,.
$$
Thus $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is parametrized by
$$
\g(t):=(\cos(t),\sin(t)) \,, \quad t \in (\theta_0,\theta_0 + 2\pi) \,.
$$ 
Since $\g$ is continuous and $(\theta_0,\theta_0 + 2\pi)$ is connected, by Theorem \ref{theorem-connected}, we conclude that $\sphere^1 \smallsetminus \{\mathbf{p}\}$ is connected. Contradiction.

### Intermediate Value Theorem

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a connected topological space. Suppose that 
$f \colon X \to \R$ is continuous. Suppose that $a,b \in X$ are such that $f(a)<f(b)$. It holds:
$$
\forall \, c \in \R \st f(a)< c < f(b) \,, \,\, \exists \, \xi \in X \st f(\xi) = c \,.
$$

:::


::: Example
### Intervals are connected - Alternative proof

**Question.** Prove the following statements.

1. Let $(X,\TT)$ be a disconnected topological space. Prove that there exists a function $f \colon X \to \{0,1\}$ which is continuous and surjective.

2. Consider $\R$ equipped with the Euclidean topology. Let $I \subseteq \R$ be an interval. Use point (1), and the Intermediate Value Theorem in $\R$ (see statement below), to show that $I$ is connected.  

*Intermediate Value Theorem in $\R$*: Suppose that $f \colon [a,b] \to \R$ is continuous, and $f(a) < f(b)$. Let $c \in \R$ be such that $f(a) \leq c \leq f(b)$. Then, there exists $\xi \in [a,b]$ such that $f(\xi) = c$.

**Solution. Part 1.** Since $X$ is disconnected, there exist $A,B \in \TT$ proper and such that
$$
X = A \cup B \,, \quad A \cap B = \emptyset \,.
$$
Define $f \colon X \to \{0,1\}$ by
$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
	0 & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, x \in A \\
	1 & \,\, \mbox{ if } \, x \in B \\
\end{cases}
$$
Since $A$ and $B$ are non-empty, it follows that $f$ is surjective. Moreover $f$ is continuous: Indeed suppose $U \subseteq \R$ is open. We have 4 cases: 

- $0,1 \notin U$. Then $f^{-1}(U) = \emptyset \in \TT$.
- $0 \in U, \, 1 \notin U$. Then $f^{-1}(U) = A \in \TT$.
- $0 \notin U, \, 1 \in U$. Then $f^{-1}(U) = B \in \TT$.
- $0,1 \in U$. Then $f^{-1}(U) = X \in \TT$.

Then $f^{-1}(U) \in \TT$ for all $U \subseteq \R$ open, showing that $f$ is continuous.

**Part 2.** Let $I \subseteq \R$ be an interval. Suppose by contradiction $I$ is disconnected. By Point (1), there exists a map $f \colon I \to \{0,1\}$ which
is continuous and surjective. As $f$ is surjective, there exist $a,b \in I$ such that 
$$
f(a) = 0 \,, \quad  f(b) = 1 \,.
$$
Since $f$ is continuous, and $f(a) = 0 < 1 = f(b)$, by the *Intermediate Value Theorem in $\R$*, there exists $\xi \in [a,b]$ such that $f(\xi)=1/2$. As $I$ is an interval, $a,b \in I$, and $a\leq \xi \leq b$, it follows that $\xi \in I$. This is a contradiction, since $f$ maps $I$ into $\{0,1\}$, and $f(\xi) = 1/2 \notin \{0,1\}$. Therefore $I$ is connected.

## Path-connectedness

::: Definition
### Path-connectedness

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a topological space. We say that $X$ is **path-connected** if for every $x,y \in X$ there exist $a,b \in \R$ with $a<b$, and a
continuous function 
$$
\alpha \colon [a,b] \to X  \,\, \st \,\, \alpha (a) = x \,, \quad \alpha(b) = y \,.
$$

:::





::: Theorem
### Path-connectedness implies connectedness {#theorem-path-connected}

Let $(X,\TT)$ be a path-connected topological space. Then $X$ is connected.

:::


::: Example

**Question.** Let $A \subseteq \R^n$ be convex. Show that $A$ is path-connected, and hence connected.


**Solution.** A is convex if for all $x,y \in A$ the segment connecting $x$ to $y$ is contained in $A$, namely,
$$
[x,y] := \{ (1-t)x + t y \divider t \in [0,1] \} \subseteq A \,.
$$
Therefore we can define
$$
\alpha \colon [0,1] \to A \,, \quad \alpha(t):=(1-t)x + t y \,.
$$
Clearly $\alpha$ is continuous, and $\alpha(0)=x, \alpha(1)=y$.

::: Example
### Spaces of matrices

Let $\R^{2 \times 2}$ denote the space of real $2 \times 2$ matrices. Assume $\R^{2 \times 2}$ has the euclidean topology obtained by identifying it with $\R^4$.

1. Consider the set of orthogonal matrices 
$$
\mathrm{O}(2) = \{ A \in \R^{2 \times 2} \, \colon \, A^TA = I \} \,.
$$
Prove that $\mathrm{O}(2)$ is disconnected.

2. Consider the set of rotations
$$
\mathrm{SO}(2) = \{ A \in \R^{2 \times 2} \, \colon \, A^TA = I ,\,\, \det(A) = 1  \} \,.
$$
Prove that $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is path-connected, and hence connected.



**Solution.** Let $A \in \mathrm{O}(2)$, and denote its entries by $a,b,c,d$. By direct calculation, the condition $A^T A = I$ is equivalent to
$$
a^2 + b^2 = 1 \,, \qquad b^2 + c^2 = 1 \,, \qquad ac + bd = 0 \,.
$$
From the first condition, we get that $a = \cos(t)$ and $b = \sin(t)$, for a suitable $t \in [0,2\pi)$. From the second and third conditions, we get $c = \pm \sin(t)$ and $d = \mp \cos(t)$. We decompose $\mathrm{O}(2)$ as
\begin{align*}
& \mathrm{O}(2) = A \cup B \,, \\
& A = \mathrm{SO}(2) = 
\left\{ 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(t) & -\sin(t) \\
\sin(t) & \cos(t)
\end{array} 
\right) , \, t \in [0,2\pi)  \right \} \\
& B = 
\left\{  
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(t) & \sin(t) \\
\sin(t) & -\cos(t)
\end{array}
\right) , \, t \in [0,2\pi)  \right \} \,.
\end{align*}


1. The determinant function $\det \colon \mathrm{O}(2) \to \R$ is continuous. If $M \in A$, we have $\det(M) = 1$. If instead $M \in B$, we have $\det(M) = -1$. Moreover,
$$
{\det}^{-1}(\{1\}) = A \,, \qquad {\det}^{-1}(\{0\}) = B \,.
$$
As $\det$ is continuous, and $\{0\},\{1\}$ closed, we conclude that $A$ and $B$ are closed. Therefore, $A$ and $B$ are closed, proper and disjoint. Since $\mathrm{O}(2) = A \cup B$, we conclude that $\mathrm{O}(2)$ is disconnected.


2. Define the function $\psi \colon [0,2\pi) \to \mathrm{SO}(2)$ by
$$
\psi(t) = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
\cos(t) & -\sin(t) \\
\sin(t) & \cos(t)
\end{array} 
\right) \,.
$$
Clearly, $\psi$ is continuous. Let $R,Q \in \mathrm{SO}(2)$. Then $R$ is determined by an angle $t_1$, while $Q$ by an angle $t_2$. Up to swapping $R$ and $Q$, we can assume $t_1 < t_2$. Define the function $f \colon [0,1] \to \mathrm{SO}(2)$ by
$$
f(\lambda) = \psi( t_1 (1-\lambda) + t_2 \lambda  ) \,. 
$$
Then, $f$ is continuous and 
$$
f(0) = \psi(t_1) = R, \quad f(1) = \psi(t_2) = Q \, .
$$
Thus $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ is path-connected.

In general connectedness does not imply path-connectedness, as seen in Proposition \ref{proposition-topologist-curve}.
